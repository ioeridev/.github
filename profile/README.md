## Hi there 👋  welcome to the ***ioeri*** documentation.
### ***ioeri*** it's means leading, pronounced /yori/, `🔊` like "iori" spoken Yoruba.

## [core - component ui repository](https://github.com/ioeridev/ioeri/tree/core)

- How do we build a component independently without depending on other components.
- How does a polymorphic component carry valid properties for itself.
- Complicated but fun to use.

You can guide or [join our community](https://github.com/ioeridev/ioeri/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to build multi-functional polymorphic projects.

## [ioericsspreset - style css preset](https://github.com/ioeridev/ioeripresetcss)

- ioeri components work in their own style, but some aspects require compatibility with other ui.
- The ui projects we build are not to be competitors or substitutes but rather to complete the specific needs that are common to users.
- `ioericsspreset` will allow that to happen and work fine by adding configuration to `postcss.config.js`.

See the [documentation](https://github.com/ioeridev/ioeripresetcss) and how it works.
